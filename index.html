        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage. The head stores the metadata.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>
          <li>Metadata is data that the browser uses to effectively serve the webpage to users. It's not seen by users, but contains information about accessibility, search engines, and performance.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS, Cascading Style Sheets, is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users.</li>
          <li>Three types of CSS are inline, internal style sheet, and external style sheet.</li>
          <li>Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, good for quick and permanent changes, but less flexible than the other two</li>
          <li>Most common way to style a webpage is using an external CSS style sheet because it allows develpers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, making design changes easier.</li>
          <li>Separation of concerns refers to separatinig code into different files based on use. Based on the idea that each section of code should have its own responsibility.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>

        <li>A variable is named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
        <li>To declare a variable use the var keyword followed by a name we give the variable. Needs to be unique.</li>
        <li>Strings include all the items falling into the category. i.e. topics would be HTML, CSS, Git, JavaScript</li>
        <li>All strings must be surrounded by quotation marks and each line of JavaScript ends in a semicolon.</li>
        <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. JavaScript is read from top to bottom, and order counts. Be intentional about setup!</li>
        <li>Can use conditional statements and loops to control the order the code is executed.</li>
        <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data, typically data that is related in some way. Arrays are zero-indexed and sequential</li>
